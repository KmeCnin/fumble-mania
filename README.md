# Fumble Mania

This project is an online role-playing games platform using [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and 
[Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/).  
  
The aim is to provide a way to play "old school" role-playing games without the need to meet all around a physical table. 
I know that there is already some softwares using remote videos conferences but here, we want to be able to play in an asynchrone way. 
Like this we are able to play when we have time, we are not constrained to be at defined time all togethers.
